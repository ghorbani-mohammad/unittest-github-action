Remarks:,,

The general criterion for the definition of berthings will be the chronological order of ship's arrival in outer anchorage area.,,

Ship's ATA will be informed by official document sent by Ship's Captain to his local Agent, and in case of doubt, Port Auhority may request a copy of the Notice of Readiness (NOR) or the Automatic Information System (AIS) record,,

of the Pilot Station.,,

(*) Please stay aware that port line-up is subject to sudden, unexpected/unforeseeable changes, contractual issues, cargo readiness and/or according Terminal's convenience.,,

Be guided that Port Authority will provide the exchange of ship's fenders along shed 101 at the begining of the second half of August (agw-wp). Such procedure will take about 3 days and no vessels may be berthed.,,
